<div><post-github-repo user="AiverAiva" repo="weikuwu.me"/> </div>  

At the age of 13, I created my very first website, which has evolved over time as I continuously maintained and enhanced it. Initially built with basic HTML and CSS, I later transitioned it to the Vue.js framework, learning a lot about modern web development along the way. This project was also where I first encountered version control and began using Git, which has been a crucial tool in my development process.

`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Vue.js`, `Nuxt.js`, `Git`, `Tailwind CSS`

This project involves a feature-rich Discord bot developed for my server, capable of handling moderation, leveling, and more. Alongside the bot, I built a website for managing its functionality using Vue.js and Nuxt.js. Additionally, I delved into backend development, creating an API for the bot and integrating it with OAuth2 for user authentication and MongoDB for persistent data storage.
